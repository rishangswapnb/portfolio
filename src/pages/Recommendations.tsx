          <p>âœ¨ "It is with great pleasure that I write this reference for Rishang, who worked for us as a software developer at Kajima from June 2023. Unfortunately, due to a change in the companyâ€™s structure, we have made the difficult decision to make their position redundant. This in no way reflects on their performance, which was consistently excellent.</p>
          <p>During their time with us, Rishang demonstrated strong technical expertise, a passion for problem-solving, a willingness to learn, and a collaborative spirit that greatly contributed to our teamâ€™s success. They played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining key features of our software <strong>BookingsPlus</strong> and <strong>NHS Open Space</strong>, consistently delivering high-quality code while meeting project deadlines. Their ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and their proactive approach to finding innovative solutions set them apart."</p>
          <p>ðŸ’¼ "Rishang also showed exceptional teamwork and communication skills, effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers, and QA. Their professionalism, positive attitude, and dedication to their work made them an asset to the team."</p>
          <p>ðŸŒŸ "I have no doubt that Rishang will be a valuable addition to any organization, and I wholeheartedly recommend them for any future opportunities."</p>
