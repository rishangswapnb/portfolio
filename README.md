# Rishang's Netflix-style TPM Portfolio

This project is a React and TypeScript web app designed to showcase my skills and experience as a Technical Program Manager. All content is served from simple JSON files so it can be hosted easily on GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start a local server with `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
The project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages.
npm install
```bash
npm run deploy
```

Your portfolio will be available at [https://rishangswapnb.github.io/portfolio](https://rishangswapnb.github.io/portfolio).

Deploying to GitHub Pages
Commit and push any changes to the main branch of your GitHub repository.

From the project root, run
